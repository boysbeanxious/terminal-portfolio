In my introduction to artificial intelligence class during my computer science studies I was tasked with calculating output of 2-input single layer perceptron by hand. As with all hand calculations they were prone to errors. What's more - I had no way to check, whether my calculations were correct. I searched for similar program on the web with no results. Therefore, I decided to create one for myself. Probably I could have found a library for this task, but I thought that it will be a good learning project nevertheless. You may find this notebook useful if you are tasked with similar problem.

This notebook solves the problem of presenting the user with results and visualisation of all the steps that perceptron algorithm took while calculating the decision boundary for 2 input points.

It is a simple example, and I do not guarantee its correctness. It works but further testing is required. I am by no mean an expert in the field of machine learning, deep learning or artificial intelligence. I created this notebook as a way to reinforce my learning and provide myself with visual representation and steps that perceptron took to get to the solution. Descriptions provided may not be accurate, may lack sufficient details and in some cases may be plainly wrong. As I mentioned earlier this notebook might be useful to someone who is a student, tasked with calculating perceptron outcome by hand, to check whether their calculations are correct or not.

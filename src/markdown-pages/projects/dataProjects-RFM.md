Country quiz is a relatively simple app that utilizes RESTCountries API to create a quiz about world countries. It was a challenge from devChallanges.io which provided the idea and a set of user stories to build the app.

I wanted to utilize the RESTCountries API since I first heard about it. My first take on it was to create a SPA (Single Page Application) that provided info about a particular country. It would be a decent learning experience nevertheless boring and not interactive. When I got the quiz idea I was sold. Managed to code it in two days thanks to TailwindCSS and React. The outcome looks good, is fun and useful.
